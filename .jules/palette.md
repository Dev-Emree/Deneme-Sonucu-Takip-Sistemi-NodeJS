## 2024-10-27 - [Missing ARIA and Keyboard Support on Custom UI Controls]
**Learning:** In this application, custom interactive elements often use non-semantic HTML tags (like `<div>` or `<a>` with only an image) without appropriate ARIA attributes. Consequently, they lack proper descriptions for screen readers (e.g., `aria-label`), are un-focusable (`tabindex="0"`), and miss crucial interaction events like `keydown` for Enter or Space. This makes critical functional aspects of the application inaccessible.
**Action:** When working on interactive features like tooltips, modals, custom buttons, or pagination, specifically look for custom-made UI elements. Always provide descriptive `aria-label` attributes to image-only interactive items. For non-button/link tags that act like buttons, add `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, and event listeners to ensure Enter and Space key interactions trigger their primary functions.
